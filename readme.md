# BackupToMail overwiev

This application is a command\-line application, which allows to upload any large file to any mailbox by splitting to segments\. Unlike Peer2Mail file sharing technology, there are some differences comparing to ordinary P2M applications:


* BackupToMail is intended to keep own data \(like backup\) in the own mailboxex\.
* BackupToMail does not generate hash information, so it is not intended to share your files to untrusted people and there is not data lose risk by losing hash information\.
* BackupToMail does not support in creating e\-mail accounts \(some P2M application can automatically create free of charge accounts on some servers\)\.
* BackupToMail can support any mailbox by POP3 or IMAP protocol to download file, and SMTP protocol to upload file\.
* BackupToMail works in console, so you can use it through text terminal connection \(telnet or ssh\) and you can execute download or upload from other application\.
* The message structure and upload/download technology is simple and easy to reproduce\.

If you run application without parameters or with unsupported action parameter, the application will print short description of command line syntax\. The action parameter is the first parameter and there is not case\-sensitive\.

# Configuration

BackupToMail uses the **Config\.txt** file to get configuration\. This file is a textual file, which contains the **parameter=value** lines, which defines general settings and account configuration\. The lines, which are not contains the **=** sign are ignored\.

## General settings

The general settings in **Config\.txt** file are following:


* **ThreadsUpload** \- Number of simultaneous threads used in uploading \(default 1\)\.
* **ThreadsDownload** \- Number of simultaneous threads used in downloading \(default 1\)\.
* **DefaultSegmentType** \- Segment type when segment type is not specified in upload command \(default 0\)\.
* **DefaultSegmentSize** \- Segment size when segment size is not specified in upload command \(default 16777216 = 16MB\)\.
* **DefaultImageSize** \- Default image size \(width\) when image size is not specified in upload command \(default 4096\)\.
* **LogFile** \- If set, the transfer information \(uploading and downloading segments\) will be recorded into the file\.
* **UploadGroupChange** \- Number of upload errors, after which the grooup of sending mailboxes will be changed to the nest group \(default 5\)\.
* **RandomCacheStepBits** \- Number of bits to specify caching period in generating the dummy file contents \(default 25, which means 32MB\)\.

When parameter is not set or has incorrect value, the default value will be used\.

## Account configuration

The **Config\.txt** file can consists the packet of settings with **Mail** followed by number prefix, the first number is 0\. Such parameter defines one e\-mail account\.

The parameters for account 0 are following:


* **Mail0Address** \- E\-mail address used as delivery address when upload\.
* **Mail0Login** \- Account login name\.
* **Mail0Password** \- Account password\.
* **Mail0SmtpHost** \- SMTP host address\.
* **Mail0SmtpPort** \- SMTP port number\.
* **Mail0SmtpSsl \(0/1\)** \- SSL usage on SMTP connection\.
* **Mail0ImapHost** \- IMAP host address\.
* **Mail0ImapPort** \- IMAP port number\.
* **Mail0ImapSsl \(0/1\)** \- SSL usage on IMAP connection\.
* **Mail0Pop3Host** \- POP3 host address\.
* **Mail0Pop3Port** \- POP3 port number\.
* **Mail0Pop3Ssl \(0/1\)** \- SSL usage on POP3 connection\.
* **Mail0Pop3Use \(0/1\)** \- Use POP3 instead of IMAP when download\. In is recommended to use IMAP protocol, but in some mailboxex POP3 can be more reliable\.
* **Mail0SmtpConnect \(0/1\)** \- Connect to SMTP server of this account directly before sending mail and disconnect after mail sending\. It can solve problems, which exists while sending several messages during one connection or if there is problem with reaining SMTP connection\.
* **Mail0DeleteIdx \(0/1\)** \- Delete index after deleting message\. Some mailboxes may delete item from index immediatelly after marking a message to delete, the other mailboxes may not delete item from index even if IMAP protocol us used\. Usually, the item is not deleted immediatelly after deleting message, the index is valid until disconnect from the mailbox\. You have to experimentally detech, which valued of the setting is appropriate for certain mailbox\.

The parameters indicated as **0/1** can have only **0** \(false\) or **1** \(true\) value\. The default value \(if parameter is not provided\) is **0**\. The account 1 has the same parameters, but with **Mail1** prefix istead of **Mail0** prefix\. Configuration is loaded as iterated loop while **Mail\_Address** is not blank\. If ypu define account 0, account 1 and account 3, ommiting account 2, the BackupToMail will load configuration for account 0 and account 1 only\.

## Configuration checking

You can check configuration and test accounts using **CONFIG** parameter\.

### General configuration checking

If you provide only first parameter, the application will print general configuration only and number of configured e\-mail accounts\.

```
BackupToMail CONFIG
```

### Account configuration checking and testing

You can provide the account numbers separated by comma \(without space separation\) as second parameter to print loaded configuration about specified account\. For print cofiguration for account 1, 2 and 4, you have to run this command:

```
BackupToMail CONFIG 1,2,4
```

You can test SMTP and IMAP/POP3 connection, if you input CONFIGTEST or TESTCONFIG parameter instead of CONFIG:

```
BackupToMail CONFIGTEST 1,2,4
```

# Map file

The main actions, such as uploading and downloading files creates or uses the map file, which must be provided to do such action\. This file can be used to:


* Get detailed information, which segment was downloaded or checked as good\.
* Continue action if application working or system working was broken during last action\.
* Download only missing segments from another mail account\.
* Upload only the segments, which are missing or bad\.

## Contents and interpretation

The map file is textual file and contains as many bytes as number of file segments\. If the file does not exist, it will be created\. The map file can consist of tharacter from the following set:


* Before action:
  * **0** \- The segment will be processed during this action\.
  * **1** \- The segment will not be processed, at the action begin, all **1** occurences will be replaced with **2** and treated as **2**\.
  * **2** \- The segment will not be processed, because it was processed during previous action using the same map file\.
* After action
  * **0** \- The segment was should to be processet, but not processed\.
  * **1** \- The segment was processed during action\.
  * **2** \- The segment was not processed, due to no necessary\.

In some cases, especially after download or cheching, the map file size may be less than number of file segments\. The map file works against the following rules:


* If map file not exists, it will be created while the first write to the file, the first read will not create the file and characters from not existing map file is treated as **0**\.
* If attemp of writing beyond end of file takes place, the file there will be extended by writing **0** character as many times, as necessary, to write required character\.
* If attemp of reading beyond end of file takes place, the file will not be modified and unread character is treated as **0**\.
* Every character other than \(**0**, **1**, **2**\) is treated as **0**\.
* Characters beyond last segment byte \(in case, where map file size is greater than number of file segments\) is ignored, but keeping the contents is not guaranteed during action\.

To simplify, actions will be described by supposing that the map file exists and consists of the same number of bytes, as the number of file segments\.

# Uploading file

To upload file, you have to access to at least one account with SMTP server and define destination accounts\. The destination account can be the same as the source account\. Before uploading file, it is highly recommended to:


* Turn off spam filter on all your destination accounts or configure spam filter bypass for messages sent from adresses of every your source account\.
* Turn off body modifiers such as signature footer when you want to upload as Base64 or PNG image in body, without attachment\.
* Turn off autoresponder on every destination account if such service is on\.
* Encrypt file or archive, the BackupToMail does not support encryption, there are several archive formats, which supports encryption, such as ZIP, 7Z and RAR\.

## Performing upload

To upload file, you have to run BackupToMail with the following parameters, the first four parameters are required, the last three parameter is optional, but every optional parameter must be provided, if you want to provide a further parameter:


1. **UPLOAD word** \- Perform upload action\.
2. **Item name** \- Item name \(identifier\) used on account \(it not must be the same as file name\)\.
3. **Data file path and name** \- Path and name of file, which you want to upload\.
4. **Map file path and name** \- Path and name of file, which you want to upload\. You can use the blank name or **/** character as name to not use map file\.
5. **Source account list** \- List of source accounts, which will be used to send messages\. You can use the **\.\.** in account list to separate the account groups\.
6. **Destination account list** \- List of destination accounts, which will be used provide message reipts into **To** field\.
7. **Segment size** \- The size of on segment other than default\.
8. **Segment type** \- The segment type other than default \(you can not provide segment type without providing segment size\), using one of the numbers:
  * **0** \- Binary attachment
  * **1** \- PNG image attachment
  * **2** \- Base64 in plain text body
  * **3** \- PNG image in HTML body
9. **Image width** \- The image wigth used, if segment type is **1** or **3** \(you can not provide image width without providing segment type\)\.

If item name, data file name or map file name contains spaces, you have to provide this parameter in quotation signs like "file name with spaces"\. The source and destination account list can not contain a spaces\. Below, there are some examples:

Upload **file\.zip** using **file\.map** as map file, save item named as **File** from accounts 1 and 2 to accounts 2 and 3, use default settings:

```
BackupToMail UPLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1,2 2,3
```

Upload the same file using the same accounts with provide 1000 image width and 1000000 bytes segment length:

```
BackupToMail UPLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1,2 2,3 1000000 1 1000
```

Upload the same file using four accounts in two groups to store in account 0:

```
BackupToMail UPLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 0,1,..,2,3 0
```

Upload **file\.zip** without map file, save item named as **File** from account 0 to account 0, use default settings:

```
BackupToMail UPLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip / 0 0
```

Upload **file\.zip** without map file, save item named as **File** from account 0 to account 0, use default settings \- alternative way:

```
BackupToMail UPLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip "" 0 0
```

Upload **file with spaces\.zip** using **file with spaces\.map** as map file, save item named as **File** as Base64 encoded in message body from account 0 to account 0\.

```
BackupToMail UPLOAD File "D:\docs by user\file with spaces.zip" "D:\docs by user\file with spaces.map" 0 0 1000000 2
```

## Upload principle

BackupToMail will upload only this segments, which are provided to upload against map file\. To upload whole file, be sure, that provided map file not exists or consists of **0** characters only\.

Before upload, all **1** occurences in the map file will be replaced with **2**\.

The number of segments of whole file is calculated based on data file size and one segment size\. The upload loop is iterated on all segments with printing informaton, which segment will be uploaded\. If there are found the same number of segments to uploads as number of upload threads, the application will assign source account to every segment to upload and the segments will be uploaded simultaneously in separate threads \(the one attemp will take place\)\. The time of preparing and sending mails will be measured and after upload attemps all segments, there will be printed upload speed based on successfully uploaded segments\.

While every segment of the threads upload failed, the application will change source account assignment from the same group and repeat upload attemp\. If some of all segments was uploaded, there will be read only as number of the segments as number of threads subtracted with number of upload failed segments\. Every failed upload will cause upload attemp repeat \(with changing source account assignment from the same group\) until such segment will be successfully uploaded\.

The account group will be changed after certain number of failures in serie, which is specified as **UploadGroupChange** value \(if not specified, the default is 5\)\. If none of account is available due to reach sending limits or internet connection break, this uploading attemps will repeaded infinitely, until sending limits on account is reset in at least of one account and internet connection is recovered\. Grouping the sending account may reduce the upload transfer obstruction caused by transfer limit per account\. Such limit exists very often in the free of charge mailboxes and are specified as certain number of messages per one hour or one day\.

After iteration of last segment, there will be performed uploading all not uploaded segment by the same way as uploading segment during iteration through segments\. It is no possible, that this action is end before uploading all segments\. Eventually, you can break this action by killing the BackupToMail process, the uploaded segments already will be denoted as **1** character in map file\.

# Downloading or checking file

To download or check file, you have to access to at least one account with IMAP or POP3 server, which keeps uploaded file\. Both actions uses the same mechanism with slightly work differences\. During downloading or checking it is possible deletion of specified kind of messages\.

## Performing download/check

To download or check file, you have to run BackupToMail with the following parameters, the first five parameters are required, the last two parameter is optional, but every optional parameter must be provided, if you want to provide a further parameter:


1. **DOWNLOAD word** \- perform download or check action\.
2. **Item name** \- Item name \(identifier\) used on account \(it not must be the same as file name\)\.
3. **Data file path and name** \- Path and name of file, which you want to upload\.
4. **Map file path and name** \- Path and name of file, which you want to upload\. You can use the blank name or **/** character as name to not use map file\.
5. **Source account list with item index intervals** \- Account list separated by commas, but pair of numbers separated by two dots \(**\.\.**\) or one number and two dots is interpreted as index interval filter \(see examples\)\.
6. **Download or check mode** \- One of available modes, which uses the same principle \(some of this modes implies no whole message download\), the mode is a number from the following:
  * **0** \- Download data file \(default mode, whis is used, if this parameter is not specified\)\.
  * **1** \- Check existence without body control\.
  * **2** \- Check existence with body control\.
  * **3** \- Check the header digest using data file\.
  * **4** \- Check the body contents using data file\.
  * **5** \- Download digest file\.
  * **6** \- Check the header digest using digest file\.
  * **7** \- Check the body contents using digest file\.
7. **Delete option list** \- List of values separated by commas, which indicates, which messages must be deleted \(additionaly with download/check action\):
  * **0** \- None\.
  * **1** \- Bad\.
  * **2** \- Duplicate\.
  * **3** \- This file\.
  * **4** \- Other messages\.
  * **5** \- Other files\.

If item name, data file name or map file name contains spaces, you have to provide this parameter in quotation signs like "file name with spaces"\. There are some examples:

Download **File** and save as **file\.zip** using **file\.map** as map file from account 1 with reading all messages:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1
```

Download **File** and save as **file\.zip** without map file from account 1 with reading all messages:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip / 1
```

Download **File** and save as **file\.zip** without map file from account 1 with reading all messages \- alternative way:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip "" 1
```

Download **File** and save as **file\.zip** using **file\.map** as map file from account 1 with reading messages from the first to 50:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1,..50
```

Download **File** and save as **file\.zip** using **file\.map** as map file from account 1 with reading messages from 30 to the last:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1,30..
```

Download **File** and save as **file\.zip** using **file\.map** as map file from account 1 with reading messages from 30 to 50:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1,30..50
```

Download **File** and save as **file\.zip** using **file\.map** as map file from account 1 with reading messages from 30 to 50, then account 3 with reading all messages:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1,30..50,2
```

Download **File** and save as **file\.zip** using **file\.map** as map file from account 1 with reading all messages, then account 3 with reading all messages:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1,2
```

Download **File** and save as **file\.zip** using **file\.map** as map file from account 1 with reading messages from 30 to 50, then account 3 with reading messages from 20 to 40:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1,30..50,2,20..40
```

Download **File** and save as **file with spaces\.zip** using **file with spaces\.map** as map file from account 1 with reading all messages:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File "D:\docs by user\file with spaces.zip" "D:\docs by user\file with spaces.map" 1
```

Check, if **File** item exists on account 1 with reading all messages, in this action data file name is not used:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File dummy D:\docs\file.map 1 1
```

Check, if **File** item exists on account 1 with reading all messages, delete bad and duplicate messages of this item, in this action data file name is not used:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File dummy D:\docs\file.map 1 1 1,2
```

Delete **File** item from account 1 and 2:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File dummy D:\docs\file.map 1,2 1 3
```

Download and delete **File** item from account 1 and 2:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File D:\docs\file.zip D:\docs\file.map 1,2 0 3
```

Clear account 1 and 2:

```
BackupToMail DOWNLOAD File dummy D:\docs\file.map 1,2 1 3,4,5
```

## Download principle

BackupToMail will download only this segments, which are provided to download against map file\. To download whole file, be sure, that provided map file not exists or consists of **0** characters only\.

Before download, all **1** occurences in the map file will be replaced with **2**\.

If you provide more than one account, the file will be downloaded from the accounts sequentially, so some segments will be downloaded from account other than the first only when the segments does not exist on previously browsed accounts\. If all neccesary segments is downloaded, the next accounts will not be browsed\.

Within one account browsing, there will be analyzed all messages in the account\. The number of messages to browse can be limited by providing index interval described in performing command description\. You can provide the first index, the last index or both the first and last index\. It is usable, when you know approximetly the index interval, within there is file to download\.

Every browsed message information is printed and the subject is analyzed to determine, if the message seems to be contain a rewuested file\. The number of file segments is not known until there will be browsed one of the segments matching to requested item \(subject contains the digest of item name\)\. Such messages will not be downloaded immediately\. The downloading will be begin, if occurs one of the following events:


* Found as number of messages containing requested file parts do download as set number od download threads\.
* After last message to download there are browsed as number of other messages as set number od download threads\.
* After browsing the last message in the browsing iteration loop\.

The time during downloading, from creating download threads to saving to file each segment from this threads, is measused and there is encountered byten of successfully downloaded segment\. After threads end, application prints download speed\.

If internet connection lost or IMAP/POP3 server is temporally unavailable while header browsing, BackupToMail reconnects and decrements iteration index by 1 to repeat header browsing attemp of the same message\. The download is performed in separated threads and there will be done one attemp of download each message, which should be downloaded\. BackupToMail checks, that message index in every connection points to the same message\. If no, all connections will be reconnected like, in case of connection lost during message download and messade download attemp will be repeated\.

If file is downloaded without deletion options, the download process ends immediately after download last missing segment\. You can download the digest file \(mode **5**\) instead of data file \(mode **0**\), thi data segments for the digest file will be downloaded exactly by the same way as download data file\.

## Digest file

Fo any data file, you can generate the digest file, which consists of digest for each data file segment\. The first 32 characters of digest file designes the file size and segment size, each occupies 16 bytes\. The further bytes are the segment digests, each consists of 32 characters\.

To generate or check the digest file, you have provide the following parameters:


1. **DIGEST word** \- generate or check the digest file\.
2. **Mode** \- One of the following modes:
  * **0** \- Create digest file based on data file\.
  * **1** \- Check digest file against data file\.
3. **Data file name** \- The name of data file, which will used to create or check the digest file
4. **Digest file name** \- The name of the digest file\.
5. **Segment size** \- The size of one data file segment\.

The first four parameters are required and the fifth parameter is optional\. If the segment size is not provided or incorrect, there will be used the default segment size\.

To create the digest **SomeArchive\.digest** of **SomeArchive\.zip** file using 1000000 segment size, you have to execute the following command:

```
BackupToMail DIGEST 0 SomeArchive.zip SomeArchive.digest 1000000
```

There will be displayed progress of digest creation\.

To check the digest **SomeArchive\.digest** against the **SomeArchive\.zip** file using 1000000 segment size, you have to execute the following command:

```
BackupToMail DIGEST 1 SomeArchive.zip SomeArchive.digest 1000000
```

There will be displayed the following information:


* Match of the data size and segment size stored in the digest file\.
* Which digests matches the data file segments\.
* Numbers of matched and mismatched segment digest\.

The digest file can be used as data file substitute to chceck the completeness and correctness of uploaded data without the original data file, especially, when the data file is very large\. You can download the digest file \(mode **5**\) instead of data file \(mode **0**\), the digests will be generated based on the data file segments\.

## Checking file

BackupToMail offers checking completeness and correctness of uploaded file by six ways:


* Check existence without body control\.
* Check existence with body control\.
* Check the header digest using data file\.
* Check the body contents using data file\.
* Check the header digest using digest file\.
* Check the body contents using digest file\.

The checking principle is the same as download principle and uses the same functionality\. There are difference compared to download: 


* Reading data file or no using data file instead of writing data file\.
* Displaying check results\.
* Process takes place to planned end, without breaking after checking all unchecked segments\.
* Some check modes takes place based on message headers instead of downloading whole message \(the **1** or **3** or **6** download/check mode\)\.

After checking, the transfer speed is displayes only for downloaded data bytes, while you perform the check mode, which requires download data\. The header data is not encountered to downloaded bytes\.

### Check existence without body control

There is the simpliest check type, it nos uses the data file name \(this parameter is ignored, although it must be provided\)\. BackupToMail researches headers of all messages, which matches to requested item name, like download action\. After find some file segment, application knowns the number of file segments\. This option can detect the following things: 


* Existence of some segments of requested file\.
* Existence of all or not all segments of file\.
* Duplicate segments\.
* Equality of number of segments in header of each existing segment \(the first found segment determines the correct number\)\.
* Equality of nominal segment size in header of each existing segment \(the first found segment determines the correct size\)\.

Thich checks does not download segments and is also useful to deletion messages\.

### Check existence with body control

The check type is similar to **Check existence without body control**, but additionally downloads segment\. This can detect the same things as above and additionally the following things: 


* The message contains readable segment bytes and is useful to download segment\.
* Compares real segment digest to digest provided in header\.

The check mode is very similar to download, the only difference is no saving the downloaded data\.

### Check the header digest

This mode reads data from provided local data file or digest name and generates the digest based on the file for every correct message, without browsing body or attachment\. The generated digest is compared with digest from header and if the digest differs, this messages is treated as bad\. This mode does not download segments from messages, it can detect: 


* Corrupted and incorrect messages\.
* Difference between local file contents and message contents by assuming that message content digest equals to digest saved in message header\.

Check the body contents like **Check the header digest**, this mode also reads the local data file or digest file, but downloads segment from body \(attachment or text\) and compares the downloaded segment with the same segment from local data file or generates the digest of the downloaded segment and compares with the digest from the digest file\. If differs, this message is bad\. 

## Deleting messages

During download or checking uploaded file, there is possible message deletion\. Because downloading or checking file requires browsing all messages \(or some messages within index interval\), there is possible to delete other messages, than messages related to requested file\. If you download with deletion options, the browsing will not be broken after downloading all segments\.

By default, no message is deleted during downloading or checking\. There are several modes of deletion, which can be combined:


* **Bad** \- Messages detected as bad during downloading or checking\.
* **Duplicate** \- Duplicate messages with existing segments\.
* **This file** \- Messages related to requested file\.
* **Other messages** \- Messages, which seems to not generated by BackupToMail\.
* **Other files** \- Messages related to other files than requested file\.

If you want to delete all existing messages from account, you have to delete map file \(if exists\) and run download or check any of file \(requested file may not exisits\) with deletion **This file**, **Other messages** and **Other files** options\.

Note: If you provide several accounts, which has the same segments, the same segments in the account other as first will be treated as duplicates\. It is recommended to run with deletion only on one account at a time\.

# Message structure

While uploading file, BackupToMail creates serie of messages \(one email per file segment\), which has specified subject and contains a file segment data\.

## Subject specification

The message subject contains the **X** character exactly 7 times, which splits the subject to 8 parts\. The first \(0\) and the last \(7\) part are not used and are blank in sending messages\.

The 6 parts from 1 to 6 can contain only digits and letters from **A** to **F**\. The parts are following:


1. Digest of file name \(result of MD5 function\)\.
2. Number of this segment decreased by 1, represented by hex number, the first segment is 0\.
3. Number of all segments decreased by 1, represented by hex number\.
4. Size of this segment \(can differ from nominal segment size in last segment\) decreased by 1, represented by hex number\.
5. Nominal segment size decreased by 1, represented by hex number\.
6. Digest of segment raw content \(result of MD5 function\)\.

The mail can store file segment data inside body or as attachment\. There are supported four segment types:


* Binary attachment
* PNG image attachment
* Base64 in plain text body
* PNG image resource used in HTML body
* PNG image embedded in HTML body

## Binary attachment specification

There is the simplest segment type\. Such message consists **data\.bin** attachment file, which contains raw segment data\. To avoid errors, the message body is not blank, and consists of **Attachment** word as plain text\.

## PNG image attachment specification

This type is simmilar to binary attachment\. The attachment is the image in PNG format, which encodes data as pixel color\. The PNG format uses lossless compression and such message can imitate the message with picture/photography\. The image is not linked in message body\. The image width is specified arbitrary, the image height results from segment size and image width\.

## Base64 in plain text body specification

The message of this type does not contain an attachment\. The segment data is encoded as Base64 and there is in plain text body\.

## PNG image resource used in HTML body specification

The message is similar to PNG image attachment, but the attachment is not a regular attached fie, instead of this, there is a resource used in HTML body, which contains the image **cid** link\. Some e\-mail application will not display the attachment as attached file\.

## PNG image embedded in HTML body specification

The message is similar to PNG image attachment, but the message does not contain an attachment\. The message consists of HTML body, where the image is embedded in HTML content\. Embedding image in HTML code complies HTML specification, but some e\-mail applications may not display image\.

# Dummy file

For the test purposes, you can use the dummy file, which is not real disk file, but it acts as same as real disk file in exception of that this file is read\-only and attempt to save to this file does not raise error\. It can be use to test transfer or store very large files without generating the real file on the disk\. The content of the file is computed by simple generators, in most cases the content are similar to pseudo\-random values\. To use dummy file, input dummy file parameters in place of the data file name\. The map file name cannot be replaced by dummy file\. The file name definition consists of the **\*** sign and has a serie of numbers separated by commas\. The parameters followed by **\*** means as following:


1. **File size** \- file size in bytes\.
2. **Generator type** \- 0 \- Linear congruential, 1 \- Fibonacci
3. **Number of bits** \- allowed values are 1, 2, 4 and 8, there is a number of least significant bits of state value, which are used to generate byte value\.
4. **A constant** \- vaue used in generator\.
5. **B constant** \- vaue used in generator\.
6. **M constant** \- vaue used in generator\.
7. **Initial vector** \- the vector values are the further parameters, for exaple if vector consists of 3 values, the generator has totally 9 parameters\.

Examples of upload 500MB dummy file and check if the file is complete and correctly uploaded:

```
BackupToMail.exe UPLOAD "TestItem" "*500000000,1,8,3,1,257,7,16,5" "TestItem.txt" 0 0
BackupToMail.exe DOWNLOAD "TestItem" "*500000000,1,8,3,1,257,7,16,5" "TestItem.txt" 0 4 0
```

You can use one of two generators, which may differs in speed and similarity to random values\. The **number of bits** beans as following:


* 1 \- use one least significant bit, use 8 values to generate one byte\.
* 2 \- use two least significant bits, use 4 values to generate one byte\.
* 4 \- use least significant nibble, use 2 values to generate one byte consisting of two nibbles\.
* 8 \- use whole value modulo by 256, as one byte\.

For example, to create whole dummy file having 1000 bytes length, when **number of bits** is specified to 2, there will be generated 4000 values and sequence of foru values will be used to generate one byte\.The values can be generated sequentially only\. There is a reason, why the generator uses cache, which stores generator state periodically during generating values of contents\. Using the cache, generator does not have to generate values from beginning to generate file segment other than the first segment\. In the gereal settings, there is the **RandomCacheStepBits** parameter, which defines the caching period by number of bits\. If you set 25 \(default value\), the generator state will be store between every 33554432 \(32M\) values\. It is recommended to set the bits to get the value between quarter segment size and double segment size but the recommendation applying is not mandatory\. 

Using the dummy file, you can test some features without managing large files, such as:


* Upload and download speed\.
* Transfer obstruction possibility due to mailbox limitations\.
* Reliability of large fire storeage\.

## Linear congruential generator

There is very simple generator\. The sequence period substantially depends on the A, B and M values\. Initial vector has always one value and the value is the initial state \(S0\)\. The next value is calculated using the following formula:

```
S[n] = (A * S[n-1] + B) mod M
```

Example for 1MB dummy file A=2, B=10, M=125, S=6 using 4 bits of number: `*1048576,0,4,2,10,125,6`

## Fibonacci generator

The generator derives from Fibonacci sequence\. Initial vector must have as number of values as the greather value from \{A, B\} set\. The next state value is calculated using the following formula:

```
S[n] = (S[n-A] + S[n-B]) mod M
```

The first value in the vector will be forgotten, but the last value will be saved nest to the formerly last value in the vector, so the vector size does not change during calculating values, but the vector stores always last values\.

Example for 1MB dummy file A=3, B=1, M=17, S=\(7,16,5\) using 4 bits of number: `*1048576,1,4,3,1,17,7,16,5`

## Create disk file

You can create real disk file,which has content the same as dummy file\. To do this, use the FILE command, for example:

```
BackupToMail FILE "*500000000,1,8,3,1,257,7,16,5" "File.bin" 10000000
```

You can use the `BATCHFILE` or `FILEBATCH` to create file without confirmation\. The last parameters \(`10000000` in example\) is the segment size used to display file creation progress\. This parameter can be ommited and there will be used default segment size\. Using this function, you can check the get acquainted with the dummy file content\.

## Period and statistics

Both described generators generates bytes in period, which in many cases can be short, depending on input parameters \(dummy file definition\)\. You can use file creating to get statistics\. To do this, you can add two additional parameters, which are numbers\. The first of these is generating file distribution, the second is calculating period length and period distribution\.

Both parameters may have on of possible values:


* **0 \- None** \- do not create statistics\.
* **1 \- Simplified dist table** \- print statistics as 16x16 table to look over the distribution at a first glance\. If value count exceedes 9999 \(four\-digit number\), all values will be divided by any power of 10 to achieve all values less than 10000\.
* **2 \- Value list with zeros** \- print count of each value including zeros\.
* **3 \- Value list without zeros** \- print count of each value excluding zeros\.

The period calculation may take a long of time depending on file size\. The progress is displayed by **period** and **occurence** values\. The algorithm tests if file contains the period of given size, begins from 1 and ends either if period found or if tested period size reach the file size\. Within testing one period length value, program checks all occurences if the maches the first occurence\. If any occurence does not match the first occurence, the further occurences will not be tested The progress will be displayed every 1 second using timer\.

Example to create file with display simple table with file distribution and period calculation with display period distribution using detailed list without zeros:

```
BackupToMail FILE "*500000000,1,8,3,1,257,7,16,5" "File.bin" 10000000 1 2
```

# Batch operations

The following operations displays the operation parameters and waits for the confirmation by user\. The operations are following:


* **UPLOAD** \- Uploading the file\.
* **DOWNLOAD** \- Downloading or cheching the file\.
* **DIGEST** \- Generating or cheching the digest file\.
* **FILE** \- Generating the data file based on dummy file parameters\.

If you execute one of the mentioned operations, there will be displayed the question **Do you want to continue \(Yes/No\)**\. If you write one of the following answers \(letter case is not important\), there will be interpreted as **Yes**: **1**, **T**, **TRUE**, **Y**, **YES**\. Other answer will be interpreted as **No**\.

You can ommit the confirmation if you add the BATCH word to operation word ass following:


* **UPLOADBATCH** or **BATCHUPLOAD**
* **DOWNLOADBATCH** or **BATCHDOWNLOAD**
* **DIGESTBATCH** or **BATCHDIGEST**
* **FILEBATCH** or **BATCHFILE**

This approach is very usable, when you want to run the BackupToMail from the script or batch file many times \(for example, to upload or download many files\)\.

# Log file

The upload and download operations can be logged to file\. To enable this feature, set the **LogFile** parameter to valid file name in **Config\.txt** configuration file\.

In the log file, BackupToMail will log every upload or download action\. In the file there will be saved the following informations:


1. Before action \- type of action and action informations such as file names and mail accounts\.
2. During action \- amount of uploaded or downloaded data during time\.
3. After action \- information abount success, transfer time, average transfer rate\.

The log file is not open always during working\. Application opens log file, adds the informatin, after this closes the log file\. If the BackupToMail will be broken suddenly \(for example, due to accidentally process killing\), the file will contain the last logged contents\.

## Transfer information

The detailed action progress informations will not stored into log file\. Instead of, there will be stored only summary of transfered data after every ending all transfer threads\. This information will have a table form and you should import/paste this text into any spreadsheet application\. The information will not generated, when you perform any checking or deleting file without downloading \(for example check the file existence based on the messahe headers only\)\.

The table will have the following columns:


1. **Time stamp** \- Current action time as number of millisecond from action start moment\.
2. **Uploaded or downloaded segments since previous entry** \- Number of segments, which was transfered after previous table entry\.
3. **Totally uploaded or downloaded segments** \- Total number of segments, which was transfered since action was began\.
4. **All segments** \- Total number of segments of file\.
5. **Uploaded or downloaded bytes since previous entry** \- Number of bytes, which was transfered after previous table entry\.
6. **Totally uploaded or downloaded bytes** \- Total number of bytes, which was transfered since action was began\.
7. **All bytes by segment count** \- All bytes to transfer based on number of segment, it will be greater than real file size, because usually the size of last segment is less than the size of each segment other than last\.
8. **All bytes by file size** \- All bytes to transfer based on the current data file size\. When uploading or comparing with file, the value meets the file size\. When downloading, the file size is less than whole file size, because one segment has not the information about file size\. In such case, the all bytes value will increase during downloading segment by segment\. It will meet the real file size after downloading the last file segment\.

The table is intended to easy detect transfer obstruction due to internet connection break or mailbox send limits during uploading\. To visualize transfer, you can make graph, which presents the number of transfered segments or bytes during time\.

For exaple, using your spreadsheet application, create the chart consisting using the **Time stamp** as values of X\-axis and **Totally uploaded or downloaded segments** as Y\-axis\. It is recommended to draw the plots connected by lines\. If no transfer obstrucion was occured, the chart will have constantly increasing trend\. Othervise, each transfer obstruction will be presented as constant trent on the chart\.

## Action details and error messages

The log file will not contain the action details in time, including mailbox error messages, which are printed on the console\. To store such data, you have to redirect BackupToMail standard output to file using operating system facilities\.
